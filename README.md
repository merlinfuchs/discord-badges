# Discord Badges

This repo contains all Discord profile badges as SVG and PNG files.

The SVG files are the exact same that the official Discord client uses.
The PNG files are automatically generated from the SVGs with a size of 128x128.

If you think a badge is missing feel free to create a PR.

## CDN

If you don't want to download the files you can use [jsdelivr](https://jsdelivr.net) to host them for you.

For example `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/merlinfuchs/discord-badges/PNG/bug_hunter_level_2.png` resolves to:

![Bug Hunter Level 2](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/merlinfuchs/discord-badges/PNG/bug_hunter_level_2.png)
